# JS ChatBot CLI

Welcome to the ChatBot CLI repository! This project demonstrates how to build a command-line interface (CLI) chatbot using JavaScript and the OpenAI API. With this chatbot, you can have interactive conversations directly from your terminal.

## Features

- Interactive conversations with the chatbot from the command line.
- Powered by the OpenAI API for natural language processing.
- Simple and easy-to-understand JavaScript codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/prasadhonrao/openai-projects

   cd js-chatbot-cli
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:

   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Usage
